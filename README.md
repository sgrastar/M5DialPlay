# M5DialPlay

## ⚠️ Spotify API Limitations

Due to Spotify's API policy changes (effective May 15, 2025),
extended quota mode is only available to organizations with 250k+ MAUs.

This project operates in development mode with a 25-user limit.
For unlimited usage, users need to create their own Spotify app.
